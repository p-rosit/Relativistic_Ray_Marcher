# Relativistic Ray Marcher

This is a project I made at LTH as a final project in EDAN35 High-Performance Computer Graphics.

This project tries to be a physically accurate ray marcher which renders images in the presence of a black hole which bends light in the ambient space. The black hole is assumed to induce a metric which bends light according to the Schwazschild metric which is the metric induced by a non-rotating black hole.
